# Tic-Tac-Toe
The game starts with empty cells and ends when someone wins or there is a draw. 

The bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:

(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)

(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)

(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

 First moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.
